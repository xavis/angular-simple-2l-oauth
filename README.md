# Angular Simple 2legged  oAuth module

With this module you can generate easily 2-legged oauth URLs in you AngularJS projects using consumer and consumer secret oAuth keys.

This module was developed to enable communication between Drupal 7 Services and a Ionic Framework App.

### Version
1.0.0

### Installation

You need bower installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g bower
```

```sh
$ bower install angular-simple-2l-oauth
```

Then you just need to add angular-simple-2l-oauth.min.js to your webapp. Writing in your index.html something like:

``
<script src="lib/angular-simple-2l-oauth/angular-simple-2l-oauth.min.js"></script>
``

### Using it

You must add 2l-oauth to your module dependencies:

``
angular.module( 'myModules', ['2l-oauth'] )
``

And now you can use it in your fabrics, services or controllers just like:

```
.factory('myFactory', function( oauth2l ) {
	var myOauthURL = (oauth2l.makeSignedRequest("CONSUMER_KEY","CONSUMER_SECRET","MY_OAUTH_PROTECTED_URL");
});
```

Or you can add directly your keys and reuse them without retyping them:

```
.factory('myFactory', function( oauth2l ) {
    oauth2l.setKeys("CONSUMER_KEY","CONSUMER_SECRET");
	var myOAuthURL = (oauth2l.makeSignedRequest("MY_OAUTH_PROTECTED_URL");
});
```
